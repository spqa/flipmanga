            Children's Privacy

            truyentranh18 does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. We make reasonable efforts to prevent someone who is underage from joining as a member of truyentranh18, and will not collect information from them. If truyentranh18 learns that a child under the age of 13 has become a member, we will close that child's account and delete any information collected about the child.

            Not withstanding the foregoing, truyentranh18 may choose to retain some personal information such as the child's e-mail address as a means to prevent the child from re-registering at our website. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) went into effect in April 2000, and as a result websites all over the world wide web had to change their standards to not collect any information from a child.
